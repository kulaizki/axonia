# Axonia

![Axonia Preview](static/axonia-opengraph-2.png)

**Axonia** is a sleek, modern, and interactive web-based viewer for NIfTI neuroimaging files (`.nii`, `.nii.gz`), built with the latest web technologies. It provides a zero-installation, browser-based solution for researchers, clinicians, and students to visualize and explore brain data instantly.

*Mapping neural pathways, one voxel at a time.*

## Core Features

-   **Instant File Loading:** Upload NIfTI files (`.nii`, `.nii.gz`) directly from your local machine. All processing happens in the browser, ensuring your data remains private.
-   **Interactive 3D & 2D Views:** Seamlessly switch between Axial, Coronal, Sagittal, and a comprehensive Multi-planar view.
-   **Dynamic Colormaps:** Apply a wide range of standard medical imaging colormaps to highlight different tissue types and structures.
-   **Intuitive Controls:**
    -   **Contrast/Brightness:** Left-click + drag
    -   **Pan:** Right-click + drag
    -   **Zoom:** Scroll wheel
    -   **Slice Navigation:** Middle-click + drag
-   **Reset View:** A one-click button to reset the view to its default state.
-   **Responsive Design:** A fully responsive interface that works beautifully on any screen size.

## Roadmap & Future Features

Axonia is an active and ongoing project. We are continuously working on adding new features to make it a more powerful tool for neuroimaging analysis. Our roadmap includes:

-   **üß† AI-Powered Analysis with Google Gemini:** Integrating Google's Gemini models to provide insightful, AI-driven analysis of imaging data, such as identifying anomalies or summarizing findings.
-   **üî¨ Advanced Statistical Learning with Nilearn:** Incorporating the Nilearn library to enable powerful statistical analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling directly within the viewer.
-   **‚úçÔ∏è Enhanced Annotation Tools:** Improving the drawing and annotation capabilities for more detailed analysis and collaboration.
